# Project Plan -- Team 01

##1 Introduction

This program counts the average number of words per sentence in an input file. It is intended to help students develop better writing skills by making them aware when they are becoming too wordy. Its target users are students of varying levels of technical skill.

## Process Description

### Activity 1
**Name**: Defining roles for the team members. 

**Description**: Identify each team memberâ€™s preferences, interests and experiences and assign relevant roles to each of the team members. 

**Entrance criteria**: Team members names, expertise in a specialised area of software engineering, previous experience with programming. 

**Exit criteria**: Well established roles for each of the team members where each team member is content with his/her roles and know what is expected out of them. We know it has been completed satisfactorily if each team member feels he will be able to perform best in that role and is excited about his position.


### Activity 2
**Name**: Requirements gathering.

**Description**: Identify the key requirements of the end user and gather hidden/grey area requirements and clarify them with the user. 

**Entrance criteria**: A set of important requirements from the user that serves as a high level objective of this project. The main inputs, the expected outputs from the project. 

**Exit criteria**: A set of clear requirements from the user, the team working on the project should have all the requirements from the project documented and checked up with the user. Satisfaction criteria is that the team feels confident about the requirements and there is no grey area left in terms of requirements and clarifications. 



### Activity 3
**Name**: Design.

**Description**: In this stage, we create a blueprint that can satisfy the well documented requirements from the previous step, identify the inputs, outputs and processes.

**Entrance criteria**: A set of clear and well defined requirements, the team members and the roles assigned to each of them.

**Exit criteria**: A well documented design document that has reasonable design solutions that sound achievable and reasonable based on the requirements and the scope of the project. Satisfaction criteria for this activity is if the design documents complements the requirements from the previous steps pretty well and provides a good platform for the developers for the next activity that is implementation.


### Activity 4
**Name**: Implementation

**Description**: In this stage we turn the above design into actual code.

**Entrance criteria**: Have a robust design for the project.

**Exit criteria**: The actual code corresponding the requirements of the project and the design documentation from the previous stage. Satisfaction criteria is that the developers are able to write high quality easy to understand code, that meets all the requirements and is in correspondence with the design document.


### Activity 5
**Name**: Verification

**Description**: In this stage we test whether the code developed fulfills the project requirements.

**Entrance criteria**: A set of tests that covers all the source code, and checks to see whether the program fulfills all the project requirements.

**Exit criteria**: All tests pass. Satisfaction criteria is that the tests pass and there is a good coverage of the code being tested.

### Activity 6
**Name**: Maintenance

**Description**: After the software is handed to the user, we will take the duty of routine maintenance activities and cater to the changes and suggestions by the user.

**Entrance criteria**: Changes and suggestions from the user after the software is handed to the user. 

**Exit criteria**: Adapt to the changes and/or suggestions from the users. Correct errors and oversights previously undetected in the verification phase. Satisfaction criteria is met when the user is content with the changes we did in the software and this actually corrected the errors/added features missed in the verification and implementation phase.


## Team

The team comprises of the following members:-

1. Yuan Ma
2. Abhishek Chatterjee
3. Abhinav Sangal
4. Himanshu Dewan


The following roles will be distributed among the abovementioned team members based on their experience and interests. A member can perform multiple roles:-

**Project manager**
The Project Manager (PM) is responsible for the overall maintenance and development of the project. His job is to ensure effective team coordination, planning a timeline and liasoning between tech-team and the customer(s).

**Principal Architect**
The Principal Architect (PA) is responsible for understanding the requirements of the project and using it to design the system; outlining the technical aspect of the project and thereby ensuring it fulfills the functional and nonfunctional requirements.

**Development lead**
The Development Lead coordinates and supervises the technical implementation of the project. The lead ensures that the developers and testers follow good coding standards and also participates in code reviews.

**Documentation lead**
The Documentation lead supervises the technical writing associated with the project. His/her job is to produce a user manual and a technical manual associated with the project based on the target audience of the document. The document lead also ensures that all the ongoings of the project (such as technical decisions, inclusion/exclusion of a feature et al) are well documented and accessible to all.

**QA manager**
The Quality Assurance Manager ensures that both automated and manual tests are in place and a proper testing standards are being followed. The test bed should be penetrative as well as exhaustive in its coverage of test-scenarios.

**Developer**
The developer has the responsibility of producing code under the supervision of the tech-lead and coordinating with other developers. A developer is also responsible for producing the test code for the feature they implement along with the integration test-bed.

**Tester**
The tester (functional and automation) are tasked with ensuring that the product being produced is in line with the requirements listed and behaves as expected. They run application against the exhaustive test cases and report bugs in case of any inconsistencies.

**Functional Requirements Analyst/Business Analyst**
The Analyst is tasked with creating user stories and storyboards based on requirements after interfacing with the customer and effectively communicating them to the PM and the team.

**UI Designer**
The UI Designer is responsible for creating an interface between the software system and the end-user to guide the user to fulfill their needs from the system, with the focus on maximizing the user experience.

**Technical Writer**
The technical writer is responsible for high-quality documentation to describe the functionality of the product and applicable standards for its intended audience, and tutorials to help end-users use a variety of applications.
